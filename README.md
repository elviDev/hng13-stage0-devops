# HNG13 DevOps Stage 0
**Name:** Ifeanyi Elvis Okeke 

**Slack Username:** @elviDev  

**Project Description:** This project deploys a static HTML webpage using **Render**, a cloud hosting platform. The page is served live at the provided Render URL, which acts as the public server endpoint. This deployment simulates a real-world DevOps workflow, where the application is version-controlled on GitHub and hosted on a cloud platform for public access.   
> Note: The live deployment for this project is hosted on **Render**, which uses **Cloudflare** for traffic management and security. As a result, the IP address provided (`216.24.57.251`) is a **Cloudflare-managed IP**, not a directly accessible server IP.  

To access the live site, please use the public **Domain** below instead of the **IP**:
